This repository contains small scale projects I worked on as I delved deeper into the world of artificial intelligence.

The code for the projects might undergo updations as I learn new things!

Each project also contains a video demo.

1. Language Translator:
   This is a basic level language translator built using the googletrans library.

  This allows for input to be recevied as either audio or text.
  
  The users can choose the required language and the translated text will be displayed and also played as audio.
